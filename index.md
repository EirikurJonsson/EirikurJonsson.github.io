# My portfolio

This is my first portfolio since I took the leap from social science to Data science. I am currently working on my masters degree in data science at the University of Southern Denmark. I will be populating this page with my personal projects and I woun't bore your with my school projects - although I will allow myself to take inspiration from them.

## My project portfolio


### [First Project - S&P 500 random portfolio generation: Finding the best](https://eirikurjonsson.github.io/pages/page1/StockRandom)
This is my first project creating random portfolios from the S&P500 index and finding the best one based on volatility first and then returns.

### [Timeseries graphing - Power of python for graping time](https://eirikurjonsson.github.io/pages/page2/timeseriesplots)

Here I created some cool functions to plot timeseries data. Its short, simple and sweet but very usefull if you are considering to start day-trading using moving averages as a part of your strategy.

### [Moving averages - Which averages to use?](https://eirikurjonsson.github.io/pages/page3/moving_averages)

I have plotted the moving averages - but how dow we know which is best? So to explore this we need to be able to create all available combinations of a set of values that will ultimately be our moving average values. That was a lot but I hope you get the picture, I am also going to find the Sharp Ratio for these values so - lets find out together.

# My portfolio

This is my first portfolio since I took the leap from social science to Data science. I am currently working on my masters degree in data science at the University of Southern Denmark. I will be populating this page with my personal projects and I woun't bore your with my school projects - although I will allow myself to take inspiration from them.

## My project portfolio

This is my [first project](https://github.com/EirikurJonsson/MyPortfolio) creating random portfolios from the S&P500 index and finding the best one based on volatility first and then returns.

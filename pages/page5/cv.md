## Experience

#### Data Scientist (Student Assistant) Bunker Holding (Current)

Last year I have worked for Bunker Holding where I have been participating in 
multiple projects that had large and direct impact on the development of an 
analytical platform. My primary focus has been on programming solutions using
Python to create visualizations, data transformations and exploratory data
analytics to generate new insights and business value.

#### Harald Nyborg (2017 - 2019) Warehouse worker

Working for Harald Nyborg I quickly went from picking orders to the recieving
department, where I was allowed to analyze data for Harald Nyborgs incoming and
out-going products to optimze the process of ordering in to the warehouse for 
the webshop in their main warehouse in Odense. This involved using the Six Sigma
philosophy along with the Lean principals.

### Post Graduate Diploma in Research Methods in Social Science (2014-2015)

Learning how to better measure human behavior is the funtimental goal of this 
program. The things I learned here gave me a particular workflow that allows me
to shrink my projects down to simpler sized objectives to allow me to finish
well and on time.
